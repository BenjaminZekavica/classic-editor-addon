The Classic Editor plugin doesn't remove Gutenberg by default. This free addon changes that and then some.

## Description

Classic Editor Addon by SO WP & Greg Schoppe - Classic Editor plugin doesn't remove Gutenberg by default. With this addon function we set the option that controls this from no-replace to replace, we remove the Settings link from the main Plugins page and we hide the Settings from the Settings > Writing screen. We also suppress the Nag screen that is slated to arrive in the Dashboard with WP version 4.9.8.
