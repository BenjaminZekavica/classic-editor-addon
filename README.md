The Classic Editor plugin doesn't remove Gutenberg by default. This free addon changes that and then some.

## Description

> GDPR-compliant: does not collect any user data

The Classic Editor plugin doesn't remove Gutenberg by default. With this free addon we set the option that controls this from no-replace to replace, so no additional action is needed anymore. This is what the Classic Editor should have done out of the box, what else is the point of using the plugin in the first place?

In addition to this most basic requirement, the Classic Editor Addon removes the Settings link from the main Plugins page and removes the plugin's Settings from the Settings > Writing screen.

Last but not least the Classic Editor Addon suppresses the Nag screen that is slated to arrive in the Dashboard with WP version 4.9.8.

The free Classic Editor Addon plugin is targeted at everyone who is not yet ready for Gutenberg and/or who does not want to bother clients with Gutenberg. Install it now on sites and by the time WP 4.9.8 and eventually 5.0 are released, the UX remains the same as you are used to!

We support this plugin exclusively through [Github](https://github.com/senlin/classic-editor-addon/issues). Therefore, if you have any questions, need help and/or want to make a feature request, please open an issue over at Github. You can also browse through open and closed issues to find what you are looking for and perhaps even help others.

Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Gutenberg?

Gutenberg is a new editing experience that will drop with WordPress 5.0, whether we like it or not. More information can be found on the [Gutenberg FAQ](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/reference/faq/).

### Why this addon? Isn't the purpose of the Classic Editor plugin to disable Gutenberg?

The Classic Editor plugin has been made available by "WordPress Contributors" supposedly to replace the Gutenberg editor and to restore the Edit Post template, but it does so only with an additional manual setting. To automate this we have released this free addon plugin.

### The plugin doesn't do anything!

Is Gutenberg active on the site and do you have the Classic Editor plugin installed? Those two are requirements for this addon plugin to do anything. If you have and the plugin still doesn't do anything, then please open a [support ticket](https://github.com/senlin/classic-editor-addon/issues).

### I have an issue with this plugin, where can I get support?
